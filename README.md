joomla-allplayersn
================================

Joomla extensions for integrating with All-Players.  
The component provides authentication functionality, and the ability to view profiles from the RESTful All-Players API.
The module simply allows a profile link (with OAuth integration) anywhere on the site.
The plugin is required by the component and allows for the authentication piece to work within Joomla.
